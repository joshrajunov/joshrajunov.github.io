    <h1>Championship Sports Viewership: Where Ratings Stand</h1>

    <p>
        Sports have been shaped by TV deals and ratings throughout modern history, and championship events draw some of the largest audiences in television history. However, for some sports, that trend hasn’t been too stable. The NBA, NHL, and MLB have seen varying numbers in the modern era.
        And then there’s the Super Bowl. The NFL’s championship has become a cornerstone of American entertainment in general, dominating viewership with hundreds of millions tuning in each year and growing.
    </p>

    <h2>The Super Bowl: An Outlier in a Changing Landscape</h2>

    <!-- Chart 1 -->
    <iframe title="Super Bowl Viewership Since 1990 (In Millions)" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-65ahU" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/65ahU/1/" scrolling="no" height="395" data-external="1"></iframe>
    <div class="chart-caption">TV audience in millions.</div>

    <p>
        Since 1990, the average viewership of the Super Bowl has been just over 97 million. This spectacle has become an American, and even global, cultural event that no sporting event can even come close to rivaling. From the commercials to the halftime show, the Super Bowl is really bigger than the football game itself.
        But not every league has been able to find this type of consistency.
    </p>

    <h2>Declining Ratings for the NBA, MLB, and NHL</h2>

    <div class="chart-caption">Championship game TV audiences in millions.</div>

    <p>
        Since 2010, the Stanley Cup Final, World Series, and NBA Finals have faced more variance.
        The Stanley Cup, while low, has been the most consistent in the past 14 years. However, the past few years have been on the up-slope. A lot of that has to do with a new TV deal the NHL signed in 2021, making Turner Sports, ESPN, and ABC the home of the Stanley Cup Playoffs and all nationally televised hockey games, with ABC showcasing the Stanley Cup Final. The deal was 4.5 billion dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
        The World Series used to be America’s biggest event. The “national pastime” has struggled with its Fall Classic since the all-time 2016 Cubs-Indians World Series, dropping 9 million viewers two years later. Still, last year’s Dodgers-Yankees final had the most fans tune in since the 2017 Fall Classic.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most discussed drop: The NBA Finals used to regularly top over 20 million viewers, but that dipped in 2020 during the COVID-19 NBA “bubble” playoffs. That Finals series averaged viewership under 8 million. After a slight uptick, the trend in viewership has been on a decline in the past three seasons. However, a new hope rises for the NBA.
    </p>

    <h2>A New Era: The NBA Returns to NBC</h2>

    <p>
        Nostalgia has been a talked-about theme among NBA fans, so the Association is bringing back the NBA on NBC. NBC’s original NBA broadcasts in the 1990s and early 2000s were iconic, with the voice of Bob Costas echoing through the ears of fans. Now, another Syracuse alum, Noah Eagle, gets to carry that legacy.
    </p>
    <p>
        “It’s exciting to be a part of the new era in the NBA, bringing back basketball on NBC,” Eagle said. “Calling the Olympics was like a dream come true... being one of the future voices of the NBA is truly an honor.”
    </p>
    <p>
        It was announced earlier this year that the 2019 Syracuse graduate will be one of the voices of the NBA on NBC. The new 11-year, 75 billion dollar plan brings excitement for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        “I don’t know much about what happened in the negotiations between the network and the league, but I know there is a lot of history between us at NBC and the NBA,” Eagle said. “I’ve grown up an NBA fan, and working around the league over the last six seasons has only grown that love.”
    </p>
    <p>
        And Eagle hopes this new form of watching through national NBC broadcasts and streams on Amazon and Peacock can unlock a new generation of viewers.
    </p>
    <p>
        “There was a discussion around ratings earlier this year. I feel there is a new wave of fans we can reach, I’m excited to grow the game.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, the Super Bowl provides a blueprint that these marquee events can still be a cornerstone of entertainment; it’s just about the presentation. With the World Series and Stanley Cup rising, plus a new deal bringing energy to the NBA, the future of sports value and entertainment is bright.
